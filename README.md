## Trident (R)emote (S)tatic (C)cooling (S)system
This mod is based on the [VzBoT RSCS](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/tree/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/RSCS) system and heavily inspired by [247printing](https://www.youtube.com/c/247printing)'s 247zero and the awesome [SCS mod](https://github.com/djsplice/SCS). Huge thanks to all these guys for sharing like a true hero so that I could bring this idea to the [Voron Trident](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident).

### What's Trident RSCS?
A cooling system that mounts a 120mm blower fan onto the side panel of Voron Trident to cool the part that is being printed

### What is the problem?
I have found that the [Voron Stealthburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner)'s 5015 part cooling fan just does not do the trick with a machine like the Trident which is capable of such high speeds. Many people have tried just adding another 5015 fan with mods like the [Mantis toolhead](https://github.com/mandryd/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Long/Mantis_Dual_5015) by Long, but this still does not produce an adequate amount of cooling

### Why try the Trident RSCS?
With high speeds and klipper, one or two 5015s is not enough. You need more cooling, with less weight on the toolhead!

### Drawbacks to using RSCS..?
1. You will have to drill some holes in your acrylic panel, which is going to be a big turn off for alot of people, but I promise, you will like it.
2. You can not use an endstop pod/hall effect pod. You have to use a micro switch on the A or B drive, and on the toolhead. You can also use sensorless
